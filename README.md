--- HOW TO PLAY ---
-------------------

The main objective of the game is to beat your opponent through dice battles. To do so, you need to strategically move around the board and gather power ups. The battle occurs when one player gets side by side with the other player.

The player one start the game. The camera indicates which player is the turn player.

Move: Use the LEFT MOUSE CLICK on the next adjacent tile to move. The player can not move diagonally.

Battle: As soon as the player gets on any adjacent tile next to the other player, the battle automatically begins. The battle is decided over auto dice roll, where each player is represented by three dices (BLUE for the player one and RED for player two). If the values are the same (6 against 6 for instance), the turn player wins the comparison. The player with more individual dice wins, wins the battle. The loser suffers damage to their health points equal to the winnerâ€™s attack power. 

As the battle end, press ENTER to return to the board.

Pause: While at the board area, press ENTER to pause and resume the game.

The game ends when one player runs out of health.

There are three different power ups, each one represented by one color. They are:

PURPLE: Gain extra attack for the rest of the turn. Each player has TWO attack points. This stat can be stacked up as much as possible, but it returns to TWO when the turn ends.

YELLOW: Gain extra move for the turn. Each player has THREE moves per round. This stat can be stacked up as much as possible, but it returns to THREE when the turn ends. The turn is changed when the player runs out of moves.

GREEN: Recover some health. Each player begins with TEN Health Points. Health can reach up to TWENTY Health Points.
